## Get started

To start a new project using this starter kit, go to the template's github repo and click on "**Use this template**" button.

Or, if you're more of a *terminal person*, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/inclinedadarsh/nextjs-starter.git your-project-name
```

Now the above command will clone the template locally. You can start using it. Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd your-project-name
bun install
```

Now start your development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Check out the [documentation](https://nextjs-docs.adarshdubey.com/) the options and customizations.
